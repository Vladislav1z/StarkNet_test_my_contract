==
This smart contract allows users to deposit ETH tokens into the contract, and allows the recipient to withdraw those tokens. The contract includes events for deposit and withdrawal transactions, and sets a minimum deposit amount to prevent spam.

To use this smart contract, you'll need to replace recipient with the address of the recipient, and minimumDeposit with the minimum amount of ETH required for deposit.

The topic of this smart contract is transferring ETH tokens between a recipient and a deposit on the StarkNet network, which can be useful for building decentralized applications or exchanging ETH tokens with other users. The contract demonstrates how to implement deposit and withdrawal functionality and emit events for transparency and traceability.
